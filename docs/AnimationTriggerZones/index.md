# Animation Trigger Zones

**Animation Trigger Zones** is a powerful Unreal Engine plugin that allows you to trigger animation montages when actors enter specific zones — all without writing a single line of C++.

This plugin is built entirely for Blueprint users and is ideal for:

- NPC interactions and gestures
- Animated cutscenes or scripted behavior
- Entry-based animation logic (e.g., chairs, buttons, terminals)
- Coordinated animations using entry points and queuing
