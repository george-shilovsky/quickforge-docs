# üíæ Saving & Loading Game State

SaveKit Lite provides simple Blueprint functions to persist and restore actor state across gameplay sessions.

## üîò Save Game

Use the node:

```
Save Kit ‚Üí SaveGame(SlotName [, ``SaveVersion``])
```


![Save Game node example](images/SaveGame1.png)
  
*This Blueprint example saves to slot `Profile_1` with version `1`.*

This will:

- Create or overwrite a save slot with the given name
- Collect all actors in the level with a `Saveable` component
- Store their transform (if enabled), custom variables, tags, and any `SaveGame` properties

---

## üîÅ Load Game

Use:

```
Save Kit ‚Üí LoadGame(SlotName)
```


![Load Game node example](images/LoadGame.png)
  
*Restores the saved state of all matching actors in the current level.*

This will:

- Load the specified save slot
- Match actors by name in the current level
- Apply the saved state to each actor that has a `Saveable` component

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure actor names in the level match the saved names.

---

## üî¢ Optional Save Version

The `SaveGame()` node includes an optional second parameter: ```SaveVersion```.

- If not specified, version defaults to `1`
- You can set a custom version manually (e.g. `2`, `5`, `1001`) to track changes in save data format

### Example: versioning use case
To detect outdated slots and act accordingly, you could compare `SaveVersion` on load:
```blueprint
if SaveVersion < 2 then ShowWarning()
```


```blueprint
SaveGame(`AutoSave`, 3)
```


![Save Game with version 3](images/SaveGame2.png)
  
*This example stores a save under slot ``AutoSave`` with version `3`.*

You can retrieve and display the version later via:

- `GetSaveSlotInfos()` ‚Üí returns ```SaveVersion``` along with slot name and time
- UI widgets (e.g. `ListView` using `SaveSlotInfoObject`)

---

## üß† Use Cases for ``SaveVersion``

- Detect outdated save slots
- Display save version in UI (e.g. `"v2"`)
- Create conditional logic to migrate or reject old saves

---


## üè∑Ô∏è What Else Gets Saved?

In addition to Saveable variables, SaveKit Lite also saves:

| Type                        | Notes                                       |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Transform                  | Saved if `Save Transform` is enabled         |
| Actor Tags                 | Saved automatically                         |
| UPROPERTY(SaveGame) fields | Saved if they support text serialization    |


## üìÅ Save Slot Location

In packaged builds, saves are stored under:

```
Saved/SaveGames/
```

This applies to both `.sav` files and their metadata.
