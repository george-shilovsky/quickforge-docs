# üß† Working with Variables

The `Saveable` component allows storing key-value string pairs during runtime.

---

## üîÅ Blueprint Functions

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è All Saveable variables are stored as strings internally.
Use `GetVariableAsInt` or manual conversion for numeric operations.

> ‚úÖ Saveable variables are ideal for counters, flags, or state values that don't need to exist as native Blueprint variables.

Available under `Save Kit ‚Üí Saveable`:

- `SetVariable(Name, Value)` ‚Äî set a string value at runtime
- `GetVariable(Name)` ‚Äî get string value
- `GetVariableAsInt(Name)` ‚Äî parse as integer
- `HasVariable(Name)` ‚Äî check if variable exists
- `IncrementVariable(Name, Amount)` ‚Äî add to numeric value
- `RemoveVariable(Name)` ‚Äî delete variable

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example: Using Saveable Functions

Use Saveable functions to manage data at runtime:

- `SetVariable` ‚Äî assign a value
- `GetVariableAsInt` ‚Äî retrieve and modify numeric values
- `IncrementVariable` ‚Äî track counts or scores

*Example: reducing Health, marking as Damaged, and incrementing HitCount.*

## üÜö Saveable Variables vs SaveGame Properties

> Use `Saveable` for lightweight, flexible runtime data.  
> Use `SaveGame` for Blueprint-visible variables and type-safe access.

| Method                | Defined In             | Access at Runtime      | Saved by SaveKit |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| `Saveable` Variables  | Saveable Component     | ‚úîÔ∏è via Blueprint nodes   | ‚úîÔ∏è Yes           |
| `SaveGame` UPROPERTY  | Actor/Blueprint field  | ‚úîÔ∏è directly (Get/Set)    | ‚úîÔ∏è Yes (if serializable) |

Use `Saveable` for flexible runtime state, and `SaveGame` for native Blueprint variables.

> Note: Actor transform, tags, and SaveGame properties are also saved.  
> See [Saving & Loading](save-load.md) for details.

## üß™ Example: Displaying Saved Data

Use `GetVariable`, `Tags`, and `SaveGame` properties to dynamically show state:

*This Blueprint formats and displays Health, HitCount, Tags, and Damaged state.*

## üö´ Limitations of Saveable Variables

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only string values are supported in Saveable variables. Complex types like vectors, rotators, and structs are not supported.


- UObject references
- Arrays of objects

Use IDs or reconstruct them manually after loading.


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See [Limitations](limitations.md) for serialization compatibility.
