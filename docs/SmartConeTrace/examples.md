## ▶️ Watch the Demo

🎥 <a href="https://youtu.be/DdDTlY605dc" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a>

In this demo, you'll see:

- A tank actor with a `SmartConeTrace` component that detects the player
- A static sensor actor using the `ConeTraceByChannel()` function manually
- The player actor also using SmartConeTrace to detect other actors
- Live tag, class, and interface filtering in action
- Full debug visualization of cone shape and hit results
- All logic implemented in Blueprints — no C++ needed

Includes:

- Third-person level with three working cone trace actors:
  - A tank with automatic forward detection
  - A scanning sensor that reacts to the player
  - The player showing trace results with different filters
- Real-time debug drawing and UI feedback

📌 Just unzip and run `SmartConeTraceEx.exe`.

You’ll get:

- Tank, Sensor, and Player Blueprints using cone trace
- Both component-based and function-based setups
- Example filters: `RequiredTags`, `RequiredClass`, `RequiredInterface`
- On-screen UI: `WBP_TraceInfo` widget
- Ready to copy and adapt

## 🎮 Real-World Usage Examples

Smart Cone Trace is flexible and can be used in many gameplay scenarios:

### 🧠 AI Vision

Give enemies, drones, or creatures a cone-based field of view.  
Trigger alerts or behaviors when the player enters their line of sight.

- Attach the component to AI characters
- Detect only specific actors (e.g. Characters with tag `"Player"`)
- React through `OnConeTraceResult` in Blueprint

---

### ✨ Area Scan Ability

Let the player scan an area in front of them on command (like a pulse).

- Call `ConeTraceByChannel()` on key press
- Highlight found objects
- Filter results by tag or interface

---

### 🔥 Ability Zones

Use cone-shaped traces for flame breath, ice blasts, or shout attacks.

- Hit multiple enemies with `bMultiHit`
- Sync VFX and SFX with the actual trace volume
- Trigger effects only for valid targets

---

### 🧩 Traps & Sensors

Use cone tracing in level geometry to detect intruders or activate traps.

- Automatically trace at intervals
- Combine with trigger boxes, cameras, or events
