## 2. Add the Component

1. Open any Actor Blueprint (like a character or AI pawn).
2. In the Components panel, click **Add Component** and choose `SmartConeTraceComponent`.
3. Select it and tweak the settings in the Details panel:
   - `Interval` â€” how often the trace runs (e.g. every 0.25 seconds)
   - `Length` â€” how far the cone reaches
   - `AngleDegrees` â€” how wide the cone is

## 3. Handle the Result

1. In the Event Graph, right-click the component and choose **"Assign On Cone Trace Result"**.
2. Use the result pin to get hit actors, check if anything was hit, etc.

*Show a simple event setup using the result â€” like printing the closest actor.*

## 4. Test It

1. Place the Actor in the level.
2. Hit **Play**.
3. The cone will automatically trace and trigger the event.

If debug mode is enabled, youâ€™ll see lines, boxes, and hit points in the viewport.
