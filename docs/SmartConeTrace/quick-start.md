# 🚀 Quick Start

This guide will help you start using **Smart Cone Trace** in less than 2 minutes.

---

## 1. Enable the Plugin

1. Open your Unreal Engine project.
2. Go to `Edit > Plugins`.
3. Search for **Smart Cone Trace** and enable it.
4. Restart the editor if prompted.

## 2. Add the Component

1. Open any Actor Blueprint (like a character or AI pawn).
2. In the Components panel, click **Add Component** and choose **SmartConeTrace**.
3. Select it and adjust the settings in the Details panel:
   - `Interval` — how often the trace runs (e.g. every 0.25 seconds)
   - `Length` — how far the cone reaches
   - `AngleDegrees` — how wide the cone is
   - `bCheckVisibility` — enable if you want to ignore objects behind walls

## 3. Handle the Result

1. In the Components panel, right-click the **SmartConeTrace** component.
2. Choose **Add Event → Add OnConeTraceResult**.

This creates an event node that fires every time the trace runs. You can access both **Hit Actors** (overlap) and **Visible Actors** (line-of-sight) from the result struct.

## 4. Test It

1. Place the actor in the level.
2. Hit **Play**.
3. The cone will automatically trace and trigger the event.

If debug mode is enabled, you’ll see the trace shape, hit boxes, and impact points.
