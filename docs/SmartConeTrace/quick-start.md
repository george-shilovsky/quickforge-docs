## 2. Add the Component

1. Open any Actor Blueprint (like a character or AI pawn).
2. In the Components panel, click **Add Component** and choose **SmartConeTrace**.
3. Select it and adjust the settings in the Details panel:
   - `Interval` â€” how often the trace runs (e.g. every 0.25 seconds)
   - `Length` â€” how far the cone reaches
   - `AngleDegrees` â€” how wide the cone is

## 3. Handle the Result

1. In the Components panel, right-click the **SmartConeTrace** component.
2. Choose **Add Event â†’ Add OnConeTraceResult**.

This creates an event node that fires every time the trace runs.

## 4. Test It

1. Place the actor in the level.
2. Hit **Play**.
3. The cone will automatically trace and trigger the event.

If debug mode is enabled, youâ€™ll see the trace shape, hit boxes, and impact points.
